# **TTS - Text-to-Speech System** 🎙️🔊  

## **Overview**  
TTS (Text-to-Speech) is an open-source project that converts written text into natural-sounding speech using advanced machine learning models. This repository provides a robust and customizable solution for speech synthesis, making it useful for applications such as assistive technology, voice assistants, audiobooks, and more.

## **Features** 🚀  
✔ **High-Quality Speech Output** – Generates natural-sounding speech with deep learning models.  
✔ **Multi-Language Support** – Supports multiple languages and accents.  
✔ **Custom Voice Cloning** – Train and fine-tune models to mimic specific voices.  
✔ **SSML Support** – Utilize Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) for better control over speech output.  
✔ **Real-Time Synthesis** – Generate speech instantly with minimal latency.  
✔ **Open-Source & Customizable** – Modify and extend features based on your needs.  

## **Installation** ⚙️  
Clone the repository and install dependencies:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/TTS.git
cd TTS
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## **Usage** 🛠️  
Convert text to speech using a simple command:  
```python
from tts import TTS

tts = TTS(model="default")  # Load pre-trained model
tts.speak("Hello, welcome to our Text-to-Speech system!")
```

You can also save the output as an audio file:  
```python
tts.save("Hello, this is an example.", "output.wav")
```

## **Supported Models** 🧠  
- Tacotron 2  
- FastSpeech 2  
- VITS (Variational Inference Text-to-Speech)  
- WaveGlow / HiFi-GAN for high-quality audio synthesis
